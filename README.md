# InstaGallery plugins
It's a repository to keep my plugins for InstaGallery: https://github.com/stuporglue/InstaGallery

## Contents
instaGallery_titles.inc - creates/updates titles.csv file, uses date of taking photo as a title

## TODO (just not to forget)
download all images from galery as zip file

Hosted on GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket - one of those will (should?) work in your organisation.
